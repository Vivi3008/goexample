Various examples of tests I do on a daily basis before implementing golang.

** NOTE: ** The examples below are for educational use only, to practice and test various possibilities of golang implementations.

Before developing projects in golang I do several unit tests and I am making my tests available to the community here, and maybe I can help with some problems or projects when you develop in golang.

It was a way I found to know more deeply the language.

I hope they help you.
